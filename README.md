# Dashboard

In this project, I built the UI of GradeScope Dashboard from Scratch with just HTML, CSS and JavaScript without using any frameworks, UI kits, or bootstraps.


- The tricky part here is to style the meter element that cross the 2 columns of the main table.
  - To make everything more semantic, I made the meter element within just one column, and used CSS to style it across 2 columns.
